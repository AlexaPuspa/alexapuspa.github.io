This is my first web page. Through this web page I apply everything I have learned about html and css. On this web page I use some Html sintags in which there are tags (header, footer, section, headings, paragraphs, tables, borders, form, input type, list, break, attribute labels, id, select, option) and layouting in css styling by using (background, font, color, border, padding, margins, text, position, display, height, width, box models, float).
